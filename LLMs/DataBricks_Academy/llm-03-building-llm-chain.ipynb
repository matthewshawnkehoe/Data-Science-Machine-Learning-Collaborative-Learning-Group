To build this we will walk through the steps needed to construct prompts and chains, as well as multiple LLM Chains that take multiple inputs, both from the previous LLM and external. \n- The second system, codenamed `DaScie` (pronounced \"dae-see\") will take the form of an LLM-based agent that will be tasked with performing data science tasks on data that will be stored in a vector database using ChromaDB. We will use LangChain agents as well as the ChromaDB library, as well as the Pandas Dataframe Agent and python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tool.\n----\n### ![Dolly](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/llm/dolly_small.png) Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n1. Build prompt template and create new prompts with different inputs\n2. Create basic LLM chains to connect prompts and LLMs.\n3. Construct sequential chains of multiple `LLMChains` to perform multi-stage reasoning analysis. \n4. Use langchain agents to build semi-automated systems with an LLM-centric agent to perform internet searches and dataset analysis.","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"a710ed32-9048-4300-8dc2-0640488d119d","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Classroom Setup","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"fabc4626-ef68-40da-8d44-70482309406a","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#%run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"160e7046-4c25-4142-bf16-9dee362e02a2","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"mkdir cache","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-23T12:46:08.597665Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-23T12:46:08.598047Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-23T12:46:09.706998Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-23T12:46:08.598019Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-23T12:46:09.705777Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%pip install wikipedia==1.4.0 google-search-results==2.4.2 better-profanity==0.7.0 sqlalchemy==2.0.15","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"41d65f5b-2106-4741-ac8a-c92eca3caab7","inputWidgets":{},"title":""},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-23T12:46:56.967141Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-23T12:46:56.967602Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-23T12:47:19.503933Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-23T12:46:56.96757Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-23T12:47:19.502604Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -U accelerate --quiet","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-23T12:47:32.249279Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-23T12:47:32.250753Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-23T12:47:45.877789Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-23T12:47:32.250695Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-23T12:47:45.876618Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install langchain","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-23T12:52:24.763037Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-23T12:52:24.763357Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-23T12:52:37.389674Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-23T12:52:24.763334Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-23T12:52:37.388855Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Generate API tokens\nFor many of the services that we'll using in the notebook, we'll need some API keys.
