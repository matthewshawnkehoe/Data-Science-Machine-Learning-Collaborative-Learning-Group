        "2. **Fine-Tunes GPT-2**  \n",
        "   - Uses Hugging Face Transformers to fine-tune GPT-2 on cleaned lyrics  \n",
        "   - Training parameters like number of epochs and batch size are adjustable\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generates New Lyrics**  \n",
        "   - Prompts the model with a custom lyric or phrase  \n",
        "   - Outputs new lyrics in the trained artist's style  \n",
        "   - Optionally formats output into sections (e.g., `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Supports Multiple Artists**  \n",
        "   - Easily swap in different lyric datasets (e.g., Blink-182, Weird Al, etc.)  \n",
        "   - Modular structure for scraping, preprocessing, training, and generation\n",
