        "For many NLP applications involving Transformer models, you can simply take a pretrained model from the Hugging Face Hub and fine-tune it directly on your data for the task at hand. Provided that the corpus used for pretraining is not too different from the corpus used for fine-tuning, transfer learning will usually produce good results.\n",

For example, if your dataset contains legal contracts or scientific articles, a vanilla Transformer model like BERT will typically treat the domain-specific words in your corpus as rare tokens, and the resulting performance may be less than satisfactory. By fine-tuning the language model on in-domain data you can boost the performance of many downstream tasks, which means you usually only have to do this step once!\n",

An example of domain adaptation with ULMFiT is shown in the image below; in this section we'll do something similar, but with a Transformer instead of an LSTM!\n",

You can specify the repository you want to push to with the `hub_model_id` argument (in particular, you will have to use this argument to push to an organization). For example, when we pushed the model to the [`huggingface-course` organization](https://huggingface.co/huggingface-course), we added `hub_model_id=\"huggingface-course/distilbert-finetuned-imdb\"` to `TrainingArguments`. By default, the repository used will be in your namespace and named after the output directory you set, so in our case it will be `\"sgugger/distilbert-finetuned-imdb\"` (which is the model we linked to at the beginning of this section).\n",
