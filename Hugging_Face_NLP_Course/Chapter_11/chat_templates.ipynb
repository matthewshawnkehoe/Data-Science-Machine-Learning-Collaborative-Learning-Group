        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Chat templates are essential for structuring interactions between language models and users. Whether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex AI agent, understanding how to properly format your conversations is crucial for getting the best results from your model. In this guide, we'll explore what chat templates are, why they matter, and how to use them effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**💡 TIP:** Chat templates are crucial for:\n",
        "- Maintaining consistent conversation structure\n",
        "- Ensuring proper role identification\n",
        "- Managing context across multiple turns\n",
        "- Supporting advanced features like tool use\n",

        "## Model Types and Templates\n",
        "\n",
        "### Base Models vs Instruct Models\n",
        "A base model is trained on raw text data to predict the next token, while an instruct model is fine-tuned specifically to follow instructions and engage in conversations. For example, [`SmolLM2-135M`](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M) is a base model, while [`SmolLM2-135M-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct) is its instruction-tuned variant.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Instruction tuned models are trained to follow a specific conversational structure, making them more suitable for chatbot applications. Moreover, instruct models can handle complex interactions, including tool use, multimodal inputs, and function calling.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make a base model behave like an instruct model, we need to format our prompts in a consistent way that the model can understand. This is where chat templates come in. ChatML is one such template format that structures conversations with clear role indicators (system, user, assistant). Here's a guide on [ChatML](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct/blob/e2c3f7557efbdec707ae3a336371d169783f1da1/tokenizer_config.json#L146).\n",
        "\n",
        "**⚠️ WARNING:** When using an instruct model, always verify you're using the correct chat template format. Using the wrong template can result in poor model performance or unexpected behavior. The easiest way to ensure this is to check the model tokenizer configuration on the Hub. For example, the `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` model uses <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct/blob/e2c3f7557efbdec707ae3a336371d169783f1da1/tokenizer_config.json#L146\">this configuration</a>.\n",

This decision might depend on his budget and how much he values the potential for better weather.\\n\\nAdditionally, Jim may want to consider other factors that could influence his decision, such as the scenic beauty, recreational activities, and amenities offered by each lake.

This information is useful in that it doesn't necessarily exonerate either of them, as they could have committed the crime together. However, it does tell us that if one of them is guilty, the other would likely be guilty as well, or at least be aware of the other's guilt.\\n\\nThe third clue states that Ben has a rock-solid alibi, which means he has a reliable and verifiable account of his whereabouts at the time of the murder, making it highly unlikely that he was the killer. With this information, we can safely rule out Ben as a suspect.\\n\\nGiven these clues, we can conclude that the murderer is likely either Alex, or Chris and/or David. The fact that Chris and David were together means that we can't rule out either of them individually, but we can say that if one of them is guilty, the other is likely involved as well. The only other suspect is Alex, who hasn't been ruled out by any of the clues. Therefore, the murderer is likely one of these three options: Alex, or Chris and/or David.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"I'm currently studying for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and I was hoping you could help me to identify the flaw in a practice argument I came across. The argument is: The company's profits have been declining for the past two years, but an analyst believes the company will return to profitability soon.
