        " In this competition, you’ll create a model to predict how well one Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) variant will do against another in a given game, based on a list of features describing the game. This challenge aims to help us figure out which MCTS variants work best in different types of games, so we can make more informed choices when applying these algorithms to new problems.\n",

        "The Ariel Data Challenge 2024 is for developing machine learning models to solve one of the most formidable challenges in the field—extracting faint exoplanetary signals from simulated observations of the upcoming ESA Ariel Mission. The task of this competition is to extract the atmospheric spectra from each observation, with an estimate of its level of uncertainty. In order to obtain such a spectrum, we require the participant to detrend a large number of sequential 2D images of the spectral focal plane taken over several hours of observing the exoplanet as it eclipses its host star. Performing this detrending process to extract atmospheric spectra and their associated error bars from raw observational data is a crucial and common prerequisite step for any modern astronomical instrument before the data can undergo scientific analysis.\n",

Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.  In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.

        "Online anonymity provides freedom of speech to many people and lets them speak their opinions in public. However, anonymous speech also has a negative impact on society and individuals. Recently, Korea has suffered a series of tragic incidents of two young celebrities that are presumed to be caused by toxic comments. Since the incidents, two major web portals in Korea decided to close the comment system in their entertainment news aggregating service. Even though the toxic comments are now avoidable on those platforms, the fundamental problem has not been solved yet. To cope with the social issue, we propose the first Korean corpus annotated for toxic speech detection. Specifically, our dataset consists of 9.4K comments from Korean online entertainment news articles. Each comment is annotated on two aspects, the existence of social bias and hate speech, given that hate speech is closely related to bias.\n",
